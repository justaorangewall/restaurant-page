# ðŸš€ RESTAURANT PAGE

This project has been created using **webpack-cli**, you can now run

```
npm run build
```

or

```
yarn build
```

to bundle your application


1.  Inside of `src/index.js` write a simple console.log or alert statement and then run `npx webpack`. Load up `dist/index.html` in a browser to make sure everything is working correctly.
    
    *   Quick tip #2: if you run `npx webpack --watch` you will not have to rerun webpack every time you make a change.
2.  Create a bare-bones homepage for a restaurant. Include an image, headline, and some copy about how wonderful the restaurant is. Itâ€™s okay to hard-code these into the HTML for now just to see how they look on the page.
    
3.  Now remove those elements from the HTML (so leave only the `<html>`, `<body>`, and `<div id="content">` tags) and instead create them by using JavaScript only, e.g. by appending each new element to `div#content` once the page is first loaded. Since weâ€™re all set up to write our code in multiple files, letâ€™s write this initial page-load function inside of its own module and then import and call it inside of `index.js`.
    
4.  Next, set up your restaurant site to use tabbed browsing to access the Contact and Menu pages. [Look at the behavior of this student solution](https://eckben.github.io/bearysBreakfastBar/) for visual inspiration.
    
    1.  Put the contents of each â€˜tabâ€™ inside of its own module. Each module will export a function that creates a div element, adds the appropriate content and styles to that element and then appends it to the DOM.
        
    2.  Write the tab-switching logic inside of `index.js`. You should have event listeners for each tab that wipes out the current contents and then runs the correct â€˜tab moduleâ€™ to populate it again.
        
5.  If you are using GitHub pages to host your completed page you need to do a tiny bit more work to get it to show up. After running `webpack` the full bundled version of your site is available in the `dist` folder, but GH pages is looking for an index.html in the root directory of your project.
    
    1.  Simply follow the instructions on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490). EZPZ!
    2.  Recall that the **source branch** for GitHub Pages is set in your repositoryâ€™s settings.
